Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis (Power BI)
This project explores greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity across industries using supply chain emission factors measured as kg CO₂e per dollar spent. The goal is to understand which sectors are most carbon-intensive and how much supply chain margins contribute to overall emissions.
Rather than focusing on total emissions alone, this analysis emphasizes emission efficiency, allowing for fair comparison across industries with different economic scales.

Key Questions
Which industries produce the highest GHG emissions per dollar spent?
How significant are supply chain margins in driving total emission intensity?
Where might sustainability efforts have the greatest impact?

Tools & Skills Used
Power BI

Key Insights
Emission intensity varies widely across industries, with waste management and heavy manufacturing sectors consistently ranking among the highest emitters per dollar spent.
Supply chain margins contribute meaningfully to total emissions, indicating that indirect emissions are a critical part of an industry’s environmental footprint.
Looking at emissions per dollar spent provides a more nuanced understanding of sustainability performance than total emissions alone.

Why This Matters
Understanding emission intensity helps businesses, policymakers, and researchers identify where efficiency improvements and supply chain interventions can have the greatest environmental impact. This type of analysis supports more informed sustainability strategies and responsible decision-making.

Outcome
The final dashboard provides a clear, professional, and accessible view of supply chain GHG emissions by industry, balancing analytics with simplicity. It is designed for both exploratory analysis and high-level communication.
